This is a Glass app to display turn-by-turn course information from a Garmin
TCX file, intended for use while biking (e.g. to follow cue sheets). 

This is currently hacky exploratory code.

Current features:
  - Displays next course point and its icon.
  - Can handle going off course and resuming at a different location.

Planned features:
  - Display speed, time and distance traveled.
  - Display time and distance left, time and distance to the next course point.
  - Display off course indication.
  - Display a map of course points.
  - All information displayed will also have the option to be read via
    text-to-speech. 
  - Detects when it's off the course and can reroute back to the course.
  - Can automatically take photos of turns or on an interval for display on a
    recorded route map later.
